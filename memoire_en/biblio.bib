The ACO algorithm is used to find good parameters for a heuristic for the SCS problem. An island model with several populations of ants is used for the ACO algorithm. Besides we introduce a lookahead function which makes the decisions of the ants dependent on the state arrived after the decision.",

abstract="An ant colony optimization algorithm using a library of partial solutions for knowledge incorporation from previous iterations is introduced. Initially, classical ant colony optimization algorithm runs for a small number of iterations and the library of partial solutions is initialized. In this library, variable size solution segments from a number of elite solutions are stored and each segment is associated with its parent's objective function value. There is no particular distribution of ants in the problem space and the starting point for an ant is the initial point of the segment it starts with. In order to construct a solution, a particular ant retrieves a segment from the library based on its goodness and completes the rest of the solution. Constructed solutions are also used to update the memory. The proposed approach is used for the solution of TSP and QAP for which the obtained results demonstrate that both the speed and solution quality are improved compared to conventional ACO algorithms.",

abstract="Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms construct solutions each time starting from scratch, that is, from an empty solution. Differently from ACO algorithms, iterated greedy, another constructive stochastic local search method, starts the solution construction from partial solutions. In this paper, we examine the performance of a variation of                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}MAX{\}}{\$}                -                                                                          {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}MIN{\}}{\$}                 Ant System, one of the most successful ACO algorithms, that exploits this idea central to iterated greedy algorithms. We consider the quadratic assignment problem as a case-study, since this problem was also tackled in a closely related research to ours, the one on the usage of external memory in ACO. The usage of external memory resulted in ACO variants, where partial solutions are used to seed the solution construction. Contrary to previously reported results on external memory usage, our computational results are more pessimistic in the sense that starting the solution construction from partial solutions does not necessarily lead to improved performance when compared to state-of-the-art ACO algorithms.",
